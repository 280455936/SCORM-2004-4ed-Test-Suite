            the corresponding link from the main Test Suite menu. 
            Java Plug-in Security Warning dialog boxes will be displayed. This is 
            because the Test Suite is reading and writing 
            files from/to the local file system via Java Applets.  Click 
            <strong>Grant this Session</strong> or <strong>Grant Always</strong> to allow 
            the Test Suite applet to run. Note that clicking <strong>Deny</strong> 
            will cause the Test Suite software to not function properly.

            <br />
            If this is not the first time the LMS Conformance Test is run, 
            prior to beginning the LMS Conformance Test ensure that the LMS
            Test Content Packages are fully removed from the LMS system and
            all global objectives associated with these content packages are removed.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Note:</strong> Check the Java Console after starting 
            the LMS Conformance Test. If there are any Java exceptions 
            reported, close all browser windows and start the test again.

                  You will be able to view any errors that were encountered, 
                  as well as the step-by-step progression of the test. When the final SCO  
                  terminates, an indication of conformance or non-conformance will be displayed in the 
                  log frame.

                  box in the LMS Test Content Package SCO will provide further   
                  instructions. These instructions will indicate 
                  how the LMS exits the current LMS Test Content Package. 
                  These instructions will also appear in the Test 
                  Suite &quot;Instructions&quot; frame.

                 If the test fails, an error message will be displayed in the Test
                 Suite Log. If you want to retry the current LMS Test Content Package,
                 click <strong>Retry</strong> or stop testing by clicking <strong>Abort</strong>. 
                 For detailed information about why the test failed, click the <strong>View
                 Detailed Log</strong> button.
                 <br />

                 Upon completion of each LMS Test Content Package, exit from the
                 package/course in the LMS. Return to the Test Suite
                 and click <strong>Continue</strong>. You may also save the current testing
                 session by clicking <strong>Save</strong> before clicking <strong>Continue</strong>. 
                 If you want to stop testing at any time click <strong>Abort</strong>.

                If a SCO encounters a problem communicating with the LMS, or an unexpected fatal error 
                occurs and the Test Suite is not able to continue, the test will stop.
                Whenever possible, the Test Suite will attempt to continue when it encounters 
                conformance errors.

            <h5 class="title">User Interface (UI) Tests</h5>
            The SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> Ed. Test Suite includes 
            several new tests in the LMS Conformance Test for testing LMS 
            provided UI Controls. These tests can be categorized as:
            <br />
            
            <p>
            <em>User Interface Inspection Tests</em><br />
               A number of LMS Test Content Packages were added or modified 
               to include UI Inspection Tests. The content packages ask  
               a series of questions about the LMS provided UI. 
               When one of these packages is encountered, respond to the questions
               based on the current state of the LMS UI. Use the following terms
               to answer the questions:
            </p>
               <ul>
               <li>
                  <b>Visible</b> - A UI device exists and is either
                  Enabled or Disabled:
                  <ul>
                  <li>
                     <b>Enabled</b> - a UI device can be triggered by the 
                     learner to invoke a given navigation event. In context of 
                     the TOC, &quot;Enabled&quot; is analogous to 
                     &quot;Selectable&quot;.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>Disabled</b> - a UI device cannot be triggered by the 
                     learner to invoke a given navigation event. A non-existent  
                     (<b>Hidden</b>) UI device is also considered 
                     &quot;Disabled&quot;.
                  </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <b>Hidden</b> - No UI device exists. The learner 
                  shall not be able to invoke the navigation event corresponding 
                  to the hidden UI device.
               </li>
               </ul>
            
            <br />
            <p>
            <em>User Interface Behavior Tests</em><br />
               A number of LMS Test Content Packages were added or modified 
               to include a number of manually navigated LMS Test Content 
               Packages. You will be prompted to sequence through the LMS 
               Test Content Package manually using the LMS provided UI. 
               When one of these packages is encountered, the LMS 
               Test Content Package will indicate the expected navigation event 
               by both popping-up an alert with the instructions and by writing 
               the instructions in the test SCO. If at any time, it is not 
               possible to trigger the specified Navigation Event from the LMS 
               provided UI, then it will not be possible to continue with the 
               LMS Conformance Test. At that time, abort the LMS Conformance Test
               by clicking <strong>Abort</strong>. The LMS is not 
               SCORM conformant due to navigation limitations in its provided UI.

            <p>When the LMS Conformance Test starts, two new buttons will appear, <b>New

                    session.  If no sessions were saved you will be presented with an
                    empty list and an option to start a new LMS test.

                    <b>Note:</b> If the log folder was moved from its 
                  original location the session will not be able to load. If 
                  this happens, a popup will appear indicating that the 
                  Summary Log cannot be found. Select another saved

            <p>The User Interface was redesigned and new functionality
               was added to simplify testing. The following buttons
               were added: <b>Continue, Retry, Save, Abort,</b> and

                     <b>Continue:</b> Used to continue from one LMS Test Content
                     Package to the next. When an LMS Test Content Package is
                     finished "Continue" will be enabled so you can proceed to
                     the next LMS Test Content Package.

                              before clicking <strong>Retry</strong>. If <strong>Retry</strong> is 
                              clicked while the LMS Test Content Package is still running, 
                              there could be problems when attempting to restart.

                     <b>Save:</b> Allows you to save a test
                      session and restart it at a later time. Saving the same session
                      more than once will overwrite the old session information.

                     Both Summary and Detailed Logs are automatically saved in the
                     folder:

                     <strong>Note:</strong> Logs are saved in this folder as a 
                     result of a portability enhancement. If you need to move logs,
                     move the entire folder and its contents since they are required
                     to properly render the logs in the browser.
            
            <p>
                  If the LMS Test Content Packages or SCOs encounter a problem 
                  communicating with the LMS, or an unexpected fatal error 
                  occurs and the testing software is not able to continue, the 
                  test will stop. Whenever possible the test software will 
                  attempt to continue when conformance errors are encountered.
