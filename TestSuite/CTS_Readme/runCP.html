   To run the Content Package Conformance Test, click the corresponding
   link from the main Test Suite menu. A Java Plug-in Security
   Warning dialog box will appear since the Test Suite is reading and writing
   files from/to the local file system via a Java Applet. Click <strong>Grant this
   Session</strong> or <strong>Grant Always</strong> to allow the Test Suite
   applet to run. Clicking <strong>Deny</strong> 
   will cause the Test Suite software to not function properly.

   The Content Package Conformance Test verifies that the content 
   package test subject complies with the SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> Ed.
   Testing Requirements.
   <br />
   <br />
   The purpose of this test is to verify that the Content Package
   test subject:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         Contains an IMS Manifest at the root of the content package 
         that:
         <ul>
            <li>Is named imsmanifest.xml.</li>
            <li>Is well-formed.</li>
            <li>
               Validates against the IMS Content Packaging XML Schema
               Definition (XSD) Version 1.1.4 ( imscp_v1p1.xsd found at 
               http://www.imsglobal.org/ ).
            </li>
            <li>
               Complies to the rules specified in the SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> Ed.
               Content Package Application Profiles.
            </li>
            <li>
               Uses extensions elements and if they are used, they are
               valid to their respective controlling document.
            </li>
            <li>
               Verifies that the sequencing information is 
               valid according to the IMS Simple Sequencing XML Schema 
               Definition (XSD) ( imsss_v1p0.xsd and supporting files 
               found at http://www.imsglobal.org/ ) if the IMS Manifest contains
               IMS Simple Sequencing Information.
      </li>
      <li>
         If the IMS Manifest contains SCORM CAM Content Packaging 
         extensions, verifies that the content packaging extensions are 
         valid according to the SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> Edition Content Packaging Extensions 
         XML XSD Version 2.0 ( adlcp_v1p3.xsd found at http://www.adlnet.gov/ ).
      </li>
      <li>
         Verifies that the sequencing extensions are valid according to 
         the SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> Ed. Sequencing Extensions XML XSD Version 2.0
         ( adlseq_v1p3.xsd found at http://www.adlnet.gov/ ) if the IMS Manifest
         contains SCORM CAM Sequencing extensions.
      </li>
      <li>
         Verifies that the navigation extensions are valid according to 
         the SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> Edition Navigation Extensions XML XSD Version 1.0 
         ( adlnav_v1p3.xsd found at http://www.adlnet.gov/ ) if the IMS
         Manifest contains SCORM CAM Navigation extensions.
      </li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
         Contains all supporting controlling documents required for 
         XML Parsing at the root of the content package.
      </li>
      <li>
         Contains optional Metadata XML Instances that are 
         well-formed and valid according to the corresponding provided 
         Controlling Document (e.g., XSD, DTD).
      </li>
      <li>
         Contains conformant SCOs as determined by the SCO RTE 
         Conformance Utility Test.
      </li>
   </ul>

   <h5 class="title">Operational Instructions</h5>
   <ol>
      <li>
         Provide the Content Package Name, Content Package Version/Release Number 
         and Content Package Vendor/Developer information.
      </li>
      <li>
         Click <strong>Continue</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
         Select the type of test to be performed by selecting the
         appropriate radio button.  You can test a Package
         Interchange File (PIF) in the form of a PKZIP 2.0.4
         (or compatible), or an uncompressed Content Package (non-PIF).  
      </li>
      <li>
         Click <strong>Continue</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
         Select the type of SCORM Content Package Application Profile
         to be tested (i.e., Content Aggregation Content Package or Resource
         Content Package) by selecting the appropriate radio button.
      </li>
      <li>
         Click <strong>Continue</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
         Click <strong>Browse</strong> to select the
         PIF zip file or the imsmanifest.xml file (for the non-PIF) that is to be 
         tested.
      </li>
      <li>
         After clicking <strong>Begin Test</strong> the
         Test Suite will test the IMS Manifest and any referenced or
         inline metadata for schema validation only.
      </li>
      <li>
         Any SCOs or assets referenced by the IMS Manifest will be tested. 
         If any SCOs or assets are listed in the IMS Manifest, the test will continue.
         Otherwise, testing is complete. If SCOs or assets exist: 
         <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Enter a SCO Timeout Value (default is 20 seconds). This 
              is the number of seconds the Test Suite will wait for the API 
              method Initialize(&quot;&quot;) to be called. If the call is not made within
               this time, the Test Suite will end and the SCO will NOT be 
               deemed conformant.  
            </li>
            <li>
            Enter an &quot;Asset Timeout Value&quot; (default is 8 seconds).  This is the 
            amount of time the Test Suite will wait to verify that an Asset does not make 
            any calls to the SCORM API.
            </li>
            <li>
               Click <strong>Continue</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
               Optionally, you may enter initialization values for any of the following 
               elements: Learner ID, Learner Name, Credit/No-Credit, Mode, or Launch 
               Data. These values represent defaults typically provided by the LMS. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Click <strong>Continue</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
               Click <strong>Launch SCO</strong> to 
               launch the first SCO or asset for testing.
            </li>
            <li>
               After the first SCO has completed testing, click 
               <strong>Complete Test</strong> in the Instructions 
               frame to quit that SCO test.
            </li>

      </li>
   </ol>
   
   <ul>
      <li>
               Any following SCO or asset will be launched and tested after
               you click <strong>OK</strong> on the pop-up window. 
               Please note that the SCOs and assets are launched by the 
               Content Package Test in a random order. All SCOs and assets 
               listed in the manifest will be tested.
            </li>
            <li>
               Use <strong>Abort Test</strong> if a call to 
               Terminate(&quot;&quot;) is not received from the SCO being tested. 
               Wait for a period of time to see if the call will 
               be invoked. If it is not, clicking <strong>Abort Test</strong> will send a call to 
               Terminate(&quot;&quot;) and end the testing, marking the SCO 
               as non-conformant.

             <strong>Note:</strong> Logs are saved in this folder as a result of a portability enhancement. 
             If you need to move logs, move the entire folder and its contents since
