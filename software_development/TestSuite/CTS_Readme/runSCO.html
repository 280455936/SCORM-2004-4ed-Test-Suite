      To run the SCO RTE Conformance Utility Test, click the corresponding link from the
      main Test Suite menu. A Java Plug-in Security Warning
      dialog box will appear because the Test Suite is reading and writing
      files from&#47;to the local
      file system via a Java Applet. Click <strong>Grant this Session</strong> or
      <strong>Grant Always</strong> to allow the Test Suite applet to
      run. Clicking <strong>Deny</strong> will cause the
      Test Suite software to not function properly. <br />

      <h5 class="title">SCO Utility Overview</h5>
      The SCO RTE Conformance Utility Test verifies that the test subject
      SCO is conformant with the SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> Ed. Testing Requirements. 
      This test will verify that the test subject:
      <ul>
         <li>Can be launched by a known conformant LMS <br />
         <br />
         </li>
         <li>Supports the Run-Time Environment Application Program Interface
         (API) functions defined in SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> Ed. <br />
         <br />
         <strong>Required</strong>
         <ul>
            <li>Initialize("")</li>
            <li>Terminate("")</li>
         </ul>
         <strong>Optional</strong>
         <ul>
            <li>Commit(&quot;&quot;)</li>
            <li>GetValue(&quot;parameter&quot;)</li>
            <li>SetValue(&quot;parameter_1&quot;,&quot;parameter_2&quot;)</li>
            <li>GetLastError()</li>
            <li>GetErrorString(&quot;parameter&quot;)</li>
            <li>GetDiagnostics()<br />            
            </li>
         </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      In addition to verification of the above requirements, this test will
      also audit which Run-Time Environment Data Model
      elements the SCO used in the content implementation, and verify
      that data elements are used in the correct manner with regard to the data
      type requirements associated with the data model elements.

      <h5 class="title">Operational Instructions</h5>
      <ul>
         <li>The test can be run on a Single SCO or Multiple SCOs. You can also save
         or load a list of SCO file paths to and from a text (.txt) file.         
         <ol>
            <li>Provide the SCO Title, SCO Version/Release Number and SCO
            Vendor/Developer.
            </li>
            <li>Click <strong>Continue</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>Enter a timeout period (default is 20 seconds). This is the
            number of seconds the Test Suite will wait for the API
            method Initialize(&quot;&quot;) to be called. If the call is not made within
            this time, the Test Suite will end and the SCO will be
            given a conformance label. 
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong> Note:</strong> If there is a possibility that the SCO may not call
            API method Initialize(&quot;&quot;) in the first 20 seconds, change this default
            value. No warning or error will be logged for changing this value.
            <br />           
            </li>
            <li>Click <strong>Browse</strong>&nbsp;to select the SCO
            that will be tested or a saved .txt file containing a list of SCO file paths.
            </li>
            <li>
               You may click <strong>Add to List</strong> to add another SCO or .txt 
               file to the list. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Click <strong>Continue</strong> after adding SCOs to the list.<br /><br /> 
               <strong>Note:</strong> If a file remains in the file input box, it will be
                appended to the list after you click <strong>Continue</strong>. <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>
               Optionally, you may enter initialization values for any of the
               following elements: Learner ID, Learner Name, Credit/No-Credit,
               Mode, Comments From LMS, Launch Data, Objective Data, Scaled Passing
               Score, Max Time Allowed, Time Limit Action or Completion Threshold.
               These values are typically defaults that are provided by the LMS or
               via a Manifest.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Note:</strong> If entering Comments From LMS or Objective Data, click
            the corresponding <strong>Add</strong> button, enter the values for the initial
            element of the array and click the corresponding <strong>Set</strong> button.
            After adding the last element of the list, click <strong>Done</strong>.
            <br />
            <br />
            </li>
            <li>Click <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>
            <li>Then click <strong>Launch SCO</strong>.</li>
            <li>Follow the necessary steps that are presented by the SCO to
            exercise the content.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Complete Test</strong> in
                the Instructions frame to finish the test.            
            </li>
            <li>
               If multiple SCOs were entered you will repeat steps 9 through 11 for each SCO to be tested.
               <br /><br />
            </li>            
         </ol>
         </li>        
         
         <li>After you click <strong>Launch SCO</strong> the
         Test Suite will launch the current SCO. <br />
         <br />
         </li>
         <li>
         The Test Suite will then wait for a call to
         Initialize(&quot;&quot;). The Test Suite will either wait for the
         call or the timeout period to expire (whichever comes first). 
         <br />
         <br />
         </li>
         <li>
         The Test Suite will wait for calls to any of the API functions listed below.
         <br />
         <br />
         </li>
         <li>
	         For Single SCO Testing: After the SCO RTE Conformance Utility Test
	         surrogate LMS receives a call to Terminate(&quot;&quot;), the SCO RTE
	         Conformance Utility Test will end. Click <strong>Complete Test</strong>
	         after this test ends to close the SCO window. 
	         <br />
	         <br />
         </li>
         <li>
	         For Multiple SCO Testing: After the SCO RTE Conformance Utility Test
	         surrogate LMS receives a call to Terminate(&quot;&quot;), the current SCO RTE
	         Conformance Utility Test will end. Click <strong>Complete Test</strong>
	         to close the current SCO window. Processing will begin for the next SCO and  
            will continue until the last SCO is tested. 
	         <br />
	         <br />
         </li>
         <li>
	         Use <strong>Abort Test</strong> if a call to Terminate(&quot;&quot;) is
            not received from the SCO being tested. Wait for a period of time to see if 
            the call will be invoked. If not, <strong>Abort Test</strong> will send
	         a call to Terminate(&quot;&quot;) and end the testing, marking the SCO as being
	         non-conformant. 
         	 <br /><br />
         </li>
         <li>
	         At the end of a successful test the Test Suite will
	         send to the Test Suite Log a set of supported features.
	         These indicate what SCORM features a SCO supports. SCORM 2004
	         4<sup>th</sup> Ed. features are:

         prompted to confirm the file to write. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save this file or
         <strong>Cancel</strong> to discard it. <br/><strong>Note: </strong> If you want to edit
         the .txt file outside the SCORTE Instructions page open the file using a text
         editor. Each SCO path is entered on a separate line of the file. <strong>File 
         paths are not validated so each line needs to be a valid path or the test will not

             <br />
             <strong>Note:</strong> Logs are saved in this folder as a result of a
             portability enhancement. If you need to move logs, please move the entire
             folder and its contents since they are required to properly render the logs
             in the browser.
         <br/>
         <br />
	         If using Internet Explorer, it is critical for Run-Time
	         API execution that the SCOs be launched from the same URL domain as
	         the SCO RTE Conformance Utility Test. The SCOs being tested will likely use some sort of
	         scripting language (i.e. JavaScript) to locate the LMS's API Adapter
	         object, which requires the use of cross frame and/or cross-window
	         scripting. For security reasons Internet Explorer requires
	         that content that performs cross frame or cross-window scripting be
	         loaded from the same domain. Refer to <a
