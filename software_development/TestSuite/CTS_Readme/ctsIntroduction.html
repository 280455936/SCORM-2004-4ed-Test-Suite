            The SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> Edition (Ed.) Test Suite Version 1.1.1
            [Referred to hereafter as the Test Suite]
            allows organizations to perform self testing on learning management systems (LMSs), 
            Sharable Content Objects (SCOs) and content packages. The Test Suite performs testing to 
            help organizations determine their conformance to SCORM 2004
            4<sup>th</sup> Ed. <strong>Note:
            This version of the Test Suite is built to assess 
            conformance with SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> Ed. The use of this
            software DOES NOT IMPLY certification to SCORM 2004 4<sup>th</sup> Ed.</strong>  
            For details on conformance and/or certification, refer

            SCORM defines a web-based learning &quot;Content Aggregation
            Model&quot; and &quot;Run-Time Environment&quot; for content objects.
            SCORM integrates a set of related technical standards, specifications,
            and guidelines designed to meet SCORM's high-level requirements-accessible,
            interoperable, durable, and reusable content and systems. SCORM content can
            be delivered to your learners via any SCORM-conformant LMS using the same version of SCORM.
            <br />
            <br />
            SCORM specifically addresses a common:
            <ol>
               <li>
                  Specification for a Content Aggregation Model which includes content
                  packaging.
               </li>
               <!-- <li>
                  A common representation of metadata that can be utilized to
                  promote discoverability and reuse.
               </li> -->
               <li>
                  Method for representing the intended behavior of an
                  authored learning experience such that any LMS will sequence
                  discrete learning activities in a consistent way.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Specification for a Run-Time Environment (RTE) that
                  facilitates interoperable communication between LMSs
                  and course content components.
               </li>
            </ol>
            The Test Suite assesses SCORM conformance by providing four testing 
            components:
            <ol>
               <li>
                  LMS Conformance Test
               </li>
               <li>
                  Content Package Conformance Test
               </li>
               <li>
                  SCO RTE Conformance Utility Test
               </li>
               <!-- <li>Metadata Conformance Utility Test</li> -->
               <li>
                  Manifest Utility Test.                  
                  <br />
               </li>
            </ol>
           <p> The Test Suite provides a common framework for all of the
            conformance tests. Each test includes a step-by-step set of
            detailed instructions as well as a log of each test action and the
            outcome.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Test Suite runs within a Web browser on one 
            local computer. All of the software is loaded on the machine and 
            requires no HTTP Web server to run.
